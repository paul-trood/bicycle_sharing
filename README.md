# bicycle_sharing

I finished the Google Data Analytics certification, but there is still one last thing to finish, and that is the Capstone project. There were two options:
Choose your own dataset to analyze
or
Bicycle sharing

I chose to download the data for the bike sharing, as I have already chosen several of my own datasets to analyze in the past. 

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
